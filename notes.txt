argument registers: RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9
floating arg reges: XMM0-XMM7
RBP, RBX, R12-R15 must be preserved by the called function
RAX or RDX:RAX are return registers. XMM0 or XMM1:XMM0 are for floats

excess args go on the stack, last to first, get removed by the caller afterwards
return address is at RSP

RSP must be 16bit aligned when a call is made. is off by 8 after a call

GLOBAL declares something is defined here and also able to be used elsewhere
EXTERN declares something is being used here that is defined elsewhere

static chain pointer: R10
